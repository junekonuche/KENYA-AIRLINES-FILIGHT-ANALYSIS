# KENYA-AIRWAYS-FILIGHT-ANALYSIS
Flight Trends and Delay Analysis for Kenya Airways using Tableau and Excel

##  Project Overview

Delays in air travel negatively affect both airlines and passengers. Kenya Airways, operating from Nairobi’s **Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO)**, experiences various delays caused by weather, technical issues, air traffic, and more. 

This project uses data analysis and visualization to:

- Calculate **average delay times**
- Identify **peak delay hours**
- Track the **most delayed routes**
- Analyze **common delay causes**
- Recommend strategies to minimize disruptions

 ##  Problem Statement
Kenya Airways, like many international carriers, faces challenges with flight delays that can impact customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and revenue. Delays may arise due to weather, maintenance issues, air traffic congestion, or crew shortages. However, without data-driven insights, it is difficult for stakeholders to identify patterns, peak times, and root causes of these delays.

This project seeks to analyze historical flight performance, identify delay trends, and uncover the major contributors to flight disruptions affecting Kenya Airways. Through data visualization and analysis, the goal is to provide actionable recommendations to improve on-time performance and optimize airline operations.

##  Objectives

-  Analyze flight performance and delay trends
-  Identify time-based delay patterns (e.g., peak hours)
-  Highlight top routes experiencing frequent delays
-  Break down root causes of delays
-  Provide practical recommendations for Kenya Airways operations

 Research Questions 
1. What are the daily and monthly trends in flight delays for Kenya Airways between 2020 and 2024?
Are there peak delay periods during specific months or years?

Do delays increase during holiday seasons or weather-affected months?

2. How has the frequency of on-time vs delayed flights changed over the years?
Has Kenya Airways improved its punctuality over time?

What percentage of flights are delayed annually?

3. Which destinations experience the most delays and what could be the reasons?
Are certain routes (e.g., regional vs international) more delay-prone?

Is congestion or airport infrastructure affecting delays?

4. What are the top contributing factors to flight delays?
Are delays mostly due to weather, technical issues, airline operations, or late-arriving aircraft?

What proportion of total delays is caused by each category?

5. When do delays most frequently occur during the day and week

Are weekends or specific weekdays more delay-prone?

6. What actionable insights can be derived to reduce delay times and improve customer satisfaction?
Can scheduling be optimized?

##  Recommendations

Based on the analysis, Kenya Airways can take the following steps to improve punctuality:

-  **Optimize turnaround time** through faster boarding and ground operations  
-  **Reschedule flights to avoid peak delay hours** (6–9 PM)  
-  **Enhance weather forecasting tools** and delay contingency plans  
-  **Improve crew and aircraft scheduling systems** to avoid cascading delays  
-  **Increase communication with passengers** through real-time updates  
-  **Monitor delay metrics regularly** using automated dashboards
