# KENYA-AIRWAYS-FILIGHT-ANALYSIS‚úàÔ∏è
Flight Trends and Delay Analysis for Kenya Airways using Tableau and Excel

##  Project Overview

Delays in air travel negatively affect both airlines and passengers. Kenya Airways, operating from Nairobi‚Äôs **Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO)**, experiences various delays caused by weather, technical issues, air traffic, and more. 

This project uses data analysis and visualization to:

- Identify **peak delay hours**
- Track the **most delayed routes**
- Analyze **common delay causes**
- Recommend strategies to minimize disruptions

 ##  Problem Statement
Kenya Airways, like many international carriers, faces challenges with flight delays that can impact customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and revenue. Delays may arise due to weather, maintenance issues, air traffic congestion, or crew shortages. However, without data-driven insights, it is difficult for stakeholders to identify patterns, peak times, and root causes of these delays.

This project seeks to analyze historical flight performance, identify delay trends, and uncover the major contributors to flight disruptions affecting Kenya Airways. Through data visualization and analysis, the goal is to provide actionable recommendations to improve on-time performance and optimize airline operations.

##  Objectives

-  Analyze flight performance and delay trends
-  Identify time-based delay patterns (e.g., peak hours)
-  Highlight top routes experiencing frequent delays
-  Break down root causes of delays
-  Provide practical recommendations for Kenya Airways operations

 Research Questions 
1.Which years have more delays than the others?
2.Which months experience the highest delays? Are the delays seasonal?
3.What proportion flights are delayed compared to those that deport on time?
4.Which destinations have most frequent delays?
5.What are the most common reasons for flight delays?
6.Which time blocks and days see the most delays?

##  Tools Used
- **Excel** - for data cleaning and preparation
- **Tableau** ‚Äì for data visualization and dashboard creation      
- **Bureau of Transportation Statistics API** ‚Äì to monitor Kenya Airways flights

##  Recommendations

Based on the analysis, Kenya Airways can take the following steps to improve punctuality:

-  **Optimize turnaround time** through faster boarding and ground operations    
-  **Enhance weather forecasting tools** and delay contingency plans  
-  **Improve crew and aircraft scheduling systems** to avoid cascading delays  
-  **Increase communication with passengers** through real-time updates  
-  **Monitor delay metrics regularly** using automated dashboards
