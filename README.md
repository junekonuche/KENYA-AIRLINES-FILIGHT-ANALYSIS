# KENYA-AIRLINES-FILIGHT-ANALYSIS
Flight Trends and Delay Analysis for Kenya Airways using Tableau &amp; Gamma AI

## 📊 Project Overview

Delays in air travel negatively affect both airlines and passengers. Kenya Airways, operating from Nairobi’s **Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO)**, experiences various delays caused by weather, technical issues, air traffic, and more. 

This project uses data analysis and visualization to:

- Calculate **average delay times**
- Identify **peak delay hours**
- Track the **most delayed routes**
- Analyze **common delay causes**
- Recommend strategies to minimize disruptions

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📈 Analyze flight performance and delay trends
- ⏰ Identify time-based delay patterns (e.g., peak hours)
- 🗺️ Highlight top routes experiencing frequent delays
- 🔍 Break down root causes of delays
- 🧠 Provide practical recommendations for Kenya Airways operations
